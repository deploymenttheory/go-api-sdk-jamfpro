# Module Package for Jamf Pro SDK

## Overview

The Module Package is designed to house a collection of reusable, utility functions. These functions are offered to enhance the development experience when creating recipes - complex operations that combine various Jamf Pro API actions to achieve specific outcomes.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this module is to:

1. **Promote Code Reusability**: By centralizing common functions, we reduce redundancy across recipes and ensure consistent implementation.

2. **Simplify Recipe Development**: Developers can focus on the unique aspects of their recipes without reinventing common operations.

3. **Enhance Maintainability**: Updates to shared functions can be made in one place, benefiting all recipes that utilize them.

4. **Extend SDK Functionality**: While not directly related to CRUD operations, these modules complement the core SDK by providing additional utility.

## Key Features

- **Utility Functions**: A rich set of helper functions that address common needs in recipe development.
- **Platform-Agnostic**: Designed to work seamlessly across different environments and use cases.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple import process to use these functions in any recipe.
- **Continuous Expansion**: Regularly updated with new utilities based on community needs and feedback.

## Usage

To use functions from this module in your recipes:

```go
import (
    "github.com/your-repo/jamfpro-sdk/modules"
)

func main() {
    result := modules.SomeUtilityFunction(params)
    // Use the result in your recipe
}
```

## Module Categories

The module package includes, but is not limited to, the following categories of functions:

1. **Data Manipulation**: Functions for parsing, formatting, and transforming data.
2. **File Operations**: Utilities for reading, writing, and managing files.
3. **Network Utilities**: Helper functions for network-related tasks.
4. **Validation**: Common validation routines used across different recipes.
5. **Logging and Debugging**: Enhanced logging and debugging capabilities.
